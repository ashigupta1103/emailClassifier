# Email Spam Classifier

This is a **Machine Learning web app** that classifies emails as **Spam** or **Not Spam** using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Naive Bayes Classifier**.
It is built entirely in **Python** and deployed using **Streamlit Cloud** ‚Äî simple, fast, and beginner-friendly.

---

## Project Overview

This project reads an email dataset, cleans and preprocesses the text using NLP techniques, then trains a **TF-IDF + Multinomial Naive Bayes** model to classify spam emails.

Unlike typical ML apps, this one **does not use pickle files** ‚Äî the model trains directly within the app.
This makes it easy to understand, run, and deploy for learners.

---

## How It Works

1. **Data Cleaning:**
   Converts text to lowercase, removes punctuation, stopwords, and applies stemming.

2. **Feature Extraction:**
   Converts text into numerical form using **TF-IDF Vectorization** (up to 3000 features).

3. **Model Training:**
   Uses **Multinomial Naive Bayes** ‚Äî a simple yet powerful algorithm for text classification.

4. **Prediction:**
   The user inputs an email message, and the app predicts if it‚Äôs **Spam** or **Not Spam**.
